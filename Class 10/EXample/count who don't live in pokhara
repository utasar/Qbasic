 Write a program to count only those records who don't live in
"POKHARA" from the data file named "record.txt" which
contains Roll number, Name, Address, and Class of several
students.
OPEN "record.txt" FOR INPUT AS #1
CLS
COUNT = 0
DO WHILE NOT EOF(1)
    INPUT #1, r, n$, a$, c
    IF UCASE$(a$) <> "POKHARA" THEN
        COUNT = COUNT + 1
    END IF
LOOP
CLOSE #1
PRINT "Number of students not living in POKHARA: "; COUNT
END
